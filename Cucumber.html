    <section>
        <h2>Planting and Growing</h2>
        <p>Cucumbers thrive in well-drained, fertile soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH. They require full sunlight for at least 6-8 hours a day. To get started, you can either sow cucumber seeds directly into the soil or begin with seedlings indoors and later transplant them outdoors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Ensure the soil is enriched with organic matter and has good water retention.</li>
            <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Plant cucumber seeds or seedlings with proper spacing to allow for healthy growth and airflow.</li>
            <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Provide consistent watering, especially during dry periods, to promote optimal fruit development.</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Some cucumber varieties benefit from trellises or supports to keep fruits off the ground.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Popular Varieties</h2>
        <p>There are various cucumber varieties, each with distinct characteristics suited for different culinary purposes. Whether you're interested in slicing cucumbers for salads or pickling cucumbers for jars, here are some popular varieties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marketmore:</strong> A classic slicing cucumber with dark green skin.</li>

        <h2>Pest and Disease Management</h2>

        <h2>Harvesting and Storage</h2>
        <p>Harvesting cucumbers at the right time ensures optimal flavor and texture. Most varieties are ready for harvest 50-70 days after planting. Harvesting should be done when the fruits are firm, well-colored, and of the desired size. Store cucumbers in the refrigerator to maintain freshness.</p>
